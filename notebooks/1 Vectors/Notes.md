# 1. Scalars and Vectors

## Scalars

A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude (size) but no direction

**Examples:**

- Temperature: 15°C
- Speed: 40 km/hr
- Mass: 10 Kg

## Vectors

A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and size

**Examples:**

- Velocity: 40 km/hr East
- Force: 20 N at 45° angle
- Displacement: 20 meters East

**Mathematically vector is represented as**

V = (v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>3</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub>)

where each component represents a coordinate in n dimensional space

# 2. Vector operations

**Addition and Subtraction of vectors**

If we have two vectors:

- A = (a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>)
- B = (b<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>)

then,

A + B = (a<sub>1</sub>+b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>+b<sub>2</sub>)

A - B = (a<sub>1</sub>-b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>-b<sub>2</sub>)

**Dot product of vectors**

The **dot product** of two vectors is given by

A.B = a<sub>1</sub>.b<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>.b<sub>2</sub> + ... + a<sub>n</sub>.b<sub>n</sub>

The dot product measures alignment between two vectors
